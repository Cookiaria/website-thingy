    <h1> Welcome to hell :3</h1>

If you somehow stumbled uppon this site from discord, bluesky or anywhere else, welcome! this is just a (WIP !!) website to introduce and talk about myself to others 🐈

In short (for now); I am Cookiaria. a 20 year old random furry person that's interested in webdev stuff, and just computers in general :3 <br>

I made art sometimes, play games, and your usual furry bullshit.

⚠ This website is still a WIP, still no support for mobile since i'm still trying to figure out how to do CSS stuff ⚠

for some reason browsers LOOOVE to cache shit and doesn't like updating my css file that often so if for some reason the website is broken, press `Shift` + `F5` or hold shift while clicking the refresh button
