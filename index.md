# Welcome to hell :3

<img src="assets/gregoriah/excited.gif" class="centered resized">

⚠ This website is still a WIP, still no support for mobile since i'm still trying to figure out how to do CSS stuff ⚠
github doesn't like updating my css file that often so if for some reason the website is broken, press `Shift` + `F5` or hold shift while clicking the refresh button

## TODO: 
- ~~Randomized subtitle messages~~
- ~~make meow noise when clicking the Cat~~
- ~~include my stupid oc on the banner~~
- MOBILE SUPPORT.
- About page (its just me testing shit right now lol)
- Actual proper welcome page because this one currently sucks ✅
- Index/search for all pages on the website 
- Art gallery
- more stuff to footer (source code, "copyleft 2024", back to top, etc)
- more to come 𝓶𝓪𝔂𝓫𝓮
