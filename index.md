~~⚠ This website is still a WIP, still no support for mobile since i'm still trying to figure out how to do CSS stuff ⚠~~ mobile support added THX pear <br> <br>
github doesn't like updating my css file that often so if for some reason the website is broken, press `Shift` + `F5` or hold shift while clicking the refresh button


stupid css
```css
.stupidcodeblock {
    margin: 50%; /* because screw you */
    display: none;
}

#idthing {
    background: url(../assets/dingus.png);
}
```

some javascript;
```js
console.log('Hello World');
```
